# User Stories

## User stories should be:
	•	Independent
	•	Negotiable
	•	Valuable
	•	Estimable
	•	Small
	•	Testable

## Stories usually comprised of:
	1. A story card
	2. Any conversations between the customer and team
	3. After delivery, customer confirmation that delivery meets acceptance criteria.


## Stories should include:
WHO wants a feature.

It is good practice to write the ‘Who’ statement in the stories from the perspective of an any person or group who will interact with the features being created. 

WHAT feature they want.

WHY they want the feature. This may be tied into a business case if one exists.

Acceptance Criteria: This is normally a list of questions, scenarios or examples that enable the customer to sign off the story as ‘done’.

## On Kanboard:

### Summary
As a <who>,/
I want <what>,/
so that <why>.

### Acceptance Criteria
Given <starting condition>,/
when <action occurs>,/
then <expected result>.

Stories define what's required from the team by the customer and stakeholders. A story is not a detailed specification of a requirement. It's a reminder that a feature needs to be delivered.

## Notes from Ben

It's supposed to be the product owner (Bruce) who writes the stories, and the developers are supposed to ask questions to verify they understand.

However, in practice, Ben and Bruce just sort of know what needs to be done, and have a hard time putting it into "story form."

Talk to Brittney. She wrote great stories for EPMA project. Dakota would also like to be there if she provides training on this.

## Notes from D9K

D9K says an "8" is one person, one sprint.

1 pt = 6 hrs = .60 x one 10-hr day
4 pts per week

Sprints are two weeks, so 4 story points per week.
