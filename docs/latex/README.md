TeX is a computer program for typesetting documents, created by D. E. Knuth. 

LaTeX, written by L. B. Lamport, is a 'dialect' of TeX. It is suited to long articles and books, since it has facilities for the automatic numbering of chapters, sections, theorems, equations etc., and also has facilities for cross-referencing.

MikTeX is a distribution of TeX for Windows, and everything you need to run LaTeX is in MikTeX.

TeXworks is the editor that comes with MikTeX.

XeLaTeX is essentially a replacement for pdfLaTeX.

Compiling a latex documents may take several steps when bibtex is used with latex. However, this latex compilation process is the same for most documents. We can make it a template with Makefile so that simply running make will generate the dvi/ps/pdf files for us.

Books:
- LaTeX Cookbook: Has example thesis, book, presentation, CV ...

> By default, when make looks for the makefile, it tries the following names, in order: GNUmakefile, makefile and Makefile.
