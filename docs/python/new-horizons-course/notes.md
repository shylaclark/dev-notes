Large datasets need to run on HPC or cluster of computers.
MS Azure has a tool for running your py script on a cluster of machines.


Data Science
Machine Learning is a subset of data science that uses existing data to train ML algorithms to make predictions of take actions on new (never seen before) data.
- Existing training data can be labelled or unlabelled.
- Labelled is 

Artificial Intelligence aims to automate complex human activities through a number of specialized computer assisted solutions.
- Some of the solutions are based on deep learning through neural networks.


Data Scientist:
- Uses existing data to train ML algorithms.
- Extensive domain knowledge is important!!!

Data Analyst uses traditional BI tools to understand and report on existing data.

Data Engineer extract, transform, and load.
