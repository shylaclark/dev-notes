# JSON

XML is generally used to structure data or messages. JSON is used to represent data as key-value pairs, which can be easily converted to and from JavaScript objects.

## Overview
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any language.

JSON is a format for storing and transporting data. It's often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.

## JSON Syntax
* Data is in name/value pairs
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects
* Square brackets hold arrays
