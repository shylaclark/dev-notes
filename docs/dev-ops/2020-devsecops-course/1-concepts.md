Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

Video: Architecting for Continuous Delivery (Jez Humble)
* Check into trunk on at least a daily basis
* Should not be deploying at night or on weekend
* New dev should be able to run one command to get everything they need to get started
* How to get rid of monolith app: Strangler Application

Can't do dev ops without CI

Continuous Delivery:
* Integrated infrastructure
* Orchestration of the environment
* Tasks are automated

Lean is inherently in Agile and DevOps
* Retrospective is example of a Lean practice
