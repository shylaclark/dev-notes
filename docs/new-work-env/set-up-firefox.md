# Set Up Firefox
Firefox doesn't work with CAC-enabled web sites, as far as I know.

Options:
* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/68.0a2/firstrun/)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)

If you install the regular version of Firefox, you'll want to install the following extensions:
* react-devtools
* redux-devtools
* web-developer
