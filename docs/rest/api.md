# APIs

## API Documentation
A detailed discussion of how the API functions and how to utilize it. Describes, with examples, how an API functions, and how to call those functions.

API documentation is meant to be read, understood, and used by humans utilizing the API, and is thus written in a format geared towards human users.

## API Specification
Gives a more broad understanding of the functionality and expected results of an API. Details the functional and expected behavior of an API, and the fundamental design philosophy and supported data types.

## API Definition
API definitions define the backbone, organization, and function of an API at a base-machine readable level. Definition, on the other hand, is more focused on the concept of machine consumption — that is, use by machines and automated systems — than on human consumption.

An API acts as an interface between two different applications so that they can communicate with each other.

An API is a method by which the third-party vendors can write programs that interface easily with other programs.

In case of Web applications, the API used is web based. 

An API doesn’t always need to be web based. It doesn’t need
a network for its operation.



An API consists of a complete set of rules and specifications for a software program to follow in order to facilitate interaction. 

Typically, “HTTP” is the most commonly used protocol for communication.

API may use any means of communication to initiate interaction between applications. 




An API exactly defines the methods for one software program to interact with the other. When this action involves sending data over a network, Web services come into the picture. An API generally involves calling functions from within a software program.




Both API and Web Service are means of communication. Difference between web services and API are: All Web services are APIs but all APIs are not Web services. ... Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may use any style for communication.
