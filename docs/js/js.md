Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive Web apps, without constant page reloads. However, this means much of the work happens on the client side, in JavaScript.

Single Page Web App Hosting
Static web apps that require only a single load in a web browser are referred to as Single page web apps. All subsequent actions by the user are made available through HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that are pre-loaded in the browser. Backend data is accessed via GraphQL or REST APIs that fetch content from a data store and update the UI without requiring a page reload.
Single page web apps offer native or desktop app-like performance. They offer all the static website benefits (low cost, high levels of reliability, no server adminstration, and scalability to handle enterprise-level traffic) with dynamic functionality and blazing fast performance.
Best for:
Websites built with Single page app frameworks such as React JS, Vue JS, Angular JS, and Nuxt.
Websites built with static site generators such as Gatsby JS, React-static, Jekyll, and Hugo.
Progressive web apps or PWAs
Websites that do not contain server-side scripting, like PHP or ASP.NET
Websites that have serverless backends.
The first tool you should turn your attention to is your web hosting. If your site’s traffic is steadily growing each day and you’re starting to notice mini spikes of traffic, or if you’re about to ramp up your marketing efforts, it’s probably time to get off that shared hosting plan and move to something more fluid and scalable.
The last thing you want is for your hosting company to call and threaten to pull your site down because it’s negatively affecting others who share server space with you. Cloud hosting plans with load balancers are a good option to consider, but if you’re unsure, talk with your web host to see what they recommend.
Your next stop needs to be a content delivery network (CDN) service. Think of this like a web hosting plan that sits on top of your web hosting plan. Does that seem like too much? It’s not if you have a large global audience who would benefit from being able to access your site from servers located closer to them. If speed and reliability of service is a concern, then a CDN is a must.
