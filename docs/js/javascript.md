## Paradigm Shift (from Java)
- Java is compiled while JavaScript code is all text.
- JavaScript only works in browsers while Java runs in a virtual machine or browser.
- Java works as an OOP Programming language while JavaScript works as an OOP Scripting Language.
JavaScript Objects

## JavaScript Variables
Variables contain a value.
`var car = "Fiat";`

## JavaScript Objects
Objects are variables too, but they can contain multiple values.

They are containers for named values called properties. Properties are written as name:value pairs (property name and property value separated by a colon).

`var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};`

```
var person = {
       firstName:"John",
       lastName:"Doe",
       age:50,
       eyeColor:"blue"
   };
```

### Access Object Properties

Two ways:

`person.firstName;`

`person["firstName"];`
