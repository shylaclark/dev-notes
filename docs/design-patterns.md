## Events

Functions can start at page load.

Events are functions that start when user clicks a link, enters a form, scrolls, moves mouse, etc. These functions "listen" for an event and then initiate the function.

## Common Event Listeners

```
onload //when the page loads
onclick //when a user clicks something
onmouseover //when a user mouses over something
onfocus //when a user puts the cursor in a form field
onblur //When a user leaves a form field
```

## Example event listener in HTML
`<button onclick="alert('Hello, world');"></button>`
