# Systems Programming

> A “system” is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.
>
> Dividing the system into smaller units allows for a simpler approach relative to the initial allocation of requirements and the subsequent analysis of the system and its functional interfaces.
>
> The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur – systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.
